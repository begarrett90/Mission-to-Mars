# Mission-to-Mars

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create a web app that includes all four hemisphere images by using BealtifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mar's hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, and use the web application to display the data.
